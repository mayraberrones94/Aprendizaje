## **Homework 1: Introduction**

> **Instructions:** Identify one or more learning problems in your thesis work and identify goals and elements.

Reading the first chapter of the recommended book, we saw several components that could be applied to our thesis work. How can we differentiate between supervised and unsupervised learning, and when to use each, with different types of techniques. 

In our case, our main objective is to use computational tools to help classify and diagnose breast cancer images. Our input data consists of four data sets, of which only three have been made publicly available.

For this objective we could identify the following problems and elements:

- **Classifying images into normal and abnormal:** This requires having a separate data set, where the model knows which images belong to the normal and abnormal sets, and corrects the output with each iteration. Here we need only two types of output, where the ones closest to 1 are determined as abnormal, and the ones closest to 0 are normal.

- **Segmentation of the image:** Here is where we single out the data in the image that we find to be abnormal. The output expected from this could be a patch of the image the model considered to be abnormal. The input of this would be the images that are considered abnormal from our last model.

- **Classifying anomalies:** The input of this step would be the patches of images with the different anomalies. The model then has to classify into their separate categories of possible malignancy with the BIRADs scale that goes from 0 to 6 different categories (number 4 having another three scales of low, moderate, and high). 

And finally, we have discussed more recently that a separation of the data set by density of breast tissue could potentially help us reduce the false negatives and false positives in our models so:

- **Classifying density of breast tissue:** The input on this problem would be the complete image, and as an output, it would classify into the four different densities of tissue stated by the [ACS](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/screening-tests-and-early-detection/mammograms/breast-density-and-your-mammogram-report.html).
